# TextToSpeech_Converter- RoboSpeaker
RoboSpeaker is a simple Python script designed to function as a basic chatbot using text-to-speech technology. The project utilizes the pyttsx3 library to convert user-inputted text into speech, providing an interactive experience. The script greets users, prompts them to enter text, and converts that input into spoken words. It includes a mechanism to gracefully exit the program by typing 'q'. 
# Prerequisites

2. pyttsx3 library (install using `pip install pyttsx3`)
# Usage
1. Enter any text, and RoboSpeaker will convert it to speech.
2. Type 'q' to quit the program.
Configuration: The script uses pyttsx3 for text-to-speech. You can configure the voice and rate in the script.
